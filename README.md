**Demo Data**

To test the platform, you can use the following demo data files:
- [Demo Data 1](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/jzQ74sZBg6naJXJ) 
- [Demo Data 2](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/dds5KzUgOmimoDf) 
- [Demo Data 3](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/RI8jhgs1tqHhGer) 
- [Demo Data 4](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/BdIbPNGqgGXrXyH)


This project is built based on [urdf-loaders](https://github.com/gkjohnson/urdf-loaders). And the URDF model of ANYmal is from RaiSim's [anymal](https://github.com/raisimTech/raisimLib/tree/master/rsc/anymal).

We gratefully acknowledge the authors and contributors of these open-source projects.
